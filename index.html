                        <p>A neural network is a machine learning program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions.
                            Every neural network consists of layers of nodes, or artificial neurons—an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each node connects to others, and has its own associated weight and threshold. If the output of any individual node is above the specified threshold value, that node is activated, sending data to the next layer of the network. Otherwise, no data is passed along to the next layer of the network.
                            Neural networks rely on training data to learn and improve their accuracy over time. Once they are fine-tuned for accuracy, they are powerful tools in computer science and artificial intelligence, allowing us to classify and cluster data at a high velocity. Tasks in speech recognition or image recognition can take minutes versus hours when compared to the manual identification by human experts.
                            One of the best-known examples of a neural network is Google’s search algorithm.
                            Neural networks are sometimes called artificial neural networks (ANNs) or simulated neural networks (SNNs). They are a subset of machine learning, and at the heart of deep learning models.

                        <h5 class="card-title">Cloud computing</h5>
                        <p>Microsoft Azure, formerly known as Windows Azure, is Microsoft's public cloud computing platform. It provides a broad range of cloud services, including compute, analytics, storage and networking. Users can pick and choose from these services to develop and scale new applications or run existing applications in the public cloud.

                            The Azure platform aims to help businesses manage challenges and meet their organizational goals. It offers tools that support all industries -- including e-commerce, finance and a variety of Fortune 500 companies -- and is compatible with open source technologies. This gives users the flexibility to use their preferred tools and technologies. In addition, Azure offers four different forms of cloud computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), software as a service (SaaS) and serverless functions.

                            Microsoft charges for Azure on a pay-as-you-go (PAYG) basis, meaning subscribers receive a bill each month that only charges them for the specific resources and services they have used.</p>

                            Australia tours
                            Travel guide
                            As the world leader in travel experiences since 1947, we connect you to the real Australia in a way like no other. Between the friendly nod of a 'g' day' and the inviting climate, Australia has gained a reputation as a warm and hospitable country; a reputation that it exceeds without a fuss. Together we'll move from the iconic to the unexpected, sailing under the gargantuan Sydney Harbour Bridge and hearing stories from the oldest civilisation on earth. Experimenting with Vegemite and falling in love with Tim Tams, this country will delight us even during the quiet moments in between adventure. It might take a lengthy plane journey to get here from many parts of the world, but you will very quickly realise why so many travellers make an effort. Perhaps when toasting the sunset at Uluru or watching penguins waddle out of the ocean after a day of fishing. Travel with us and unlock the infinite possibilities thanks to our exclusive Trafalgar Highlights.
